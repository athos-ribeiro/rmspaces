## rmspaces

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/athos-ribeiro/rmspaces.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/athos-ribeiro/rmspaces)
[![CPAN version](https://badge.fury.io/pl/App-rmspaces.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/pl/App-rmspaces)

This is a perl application to remove those anoying, lame, awful spaces from
file names. Just run `rmspaces FILENAME`.

Note that it could also be used to change multiple file names by using the
--target and the --separator arguments. For example, if you have

```
$ ls
march_report  march_status  march_updates
```

`rmspaces -t march -s 032017 *`

would move the files in the current directory to:

```
$ ls
032017_report  032017_status  032017_updates
```

Check `rmspaces --help` for more information or check the docstrings in the
source code.
